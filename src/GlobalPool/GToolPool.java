/**
 * This class is similar as an local tool pool, but it managed all tools 
 * available in the hospital (i.e manager), included the ones stored in the 
 * storage room.
 * 
 * The functionality of this approach is to provide a centralized place to 
 * store all data/information about the tools, as well as cross-checking them
 * to all distribution places/centers such as LToolPool.class and report them 
 * to GLogger.class.
