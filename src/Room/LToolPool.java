/**
 * This class is to bind the relationship between the "RoomUnit" with the "ObjectRoom", 
 * "PatientRoom", and "MedicoRoom". In the "ObjectRoom" (which is a combination of the
 * "LToolPool" and "LResourcesPool"). The relationship can be implicitly described below:
 * 
 * Denoted a "RoomUnit" is a single room in the hospital. According to the "Software Architecture, 
 * Desgin & Engineering" and the "Principle of Database Management":
 * 1) PatientRoom: On each room, we assume a bed is for one patient, but since the number of
 *    bed is not fixed (undefined), but because the bed can be either empty or not, so the 
 *    primary key of the "PatientRoom" is the {"RoomUnit.ID", "Patient.ID", "Bed Index"}.
 *  
 * 2) MedicoRoom: In this scenario, the relationship is somehow related to the business logic.
 *    rather than the common ideology. In the "MedicoRoom", we assume that there must be at 
 *    least one medico responsible for that room (can be more than two). Thus the primary 
 *    key is the {"RoomUnit.ID", (Responsible) "Medico.ID"}.
 * 
 * 3) ObjectRoom: In this scenario, the relationship is somehow related to the Medico, but in 
 *    the program, this constraint is undefined. But in a simple manner, there are no different
 *    between the LToolPool and LResourcePool, which are both the collection of <Tool> and 
 *    <Resource>. Thus the primary key of the "ObjectRoom" is the {"RoomUnit.ID", "Object.ID"}.
 * 
 * See the note in "BaseClass.BaseObjectPool" for more details.
